This seems to be the hardest part of all my projects, finishing them

Actually, I find it difficult to let the theory behind the monte carlo system
settle in my head. I do get what it's presence in the project means but I'm 
finding it difficult to go ahead and finish it even though I've gone great lengths to
research and understand it. And my mental health has taken a hi`t because I'm blaming myself
for it, maybe rightfully so. Finishing this up even I don't get over the understanding
of monte carlo will mean a lot to me. ::smile::
